## Features

### Logo and Navigation bar

A responsive navigation bar is in place. Concentrating on 'mobile first' design, the navigation bar incorporates a clickable burger icon with a drop down menu on mobile. When moving to tablet and monitor size the burger disappears and a traditional navigation bar appears with options to navigate to pages; 'Home', 'Around the World' or 'Contact'. There is a clickable horse logo for monitor sizes. This design benefits the user as it is intuitive and a common nav bar design. It is inviting to use, because it is easy to navigate.

#### Monitor navigation bar with clickable horse logo

### Hero Image

The hero image on the index page was chosen to convey the exact purpose of Whisper Riding School. It is a colourful image of a girl jumping a fence on horseback in a sand arena. This is a typical activity you would find at a riding school in Ireland. Therefore, the user can see what typically happens at our farm.

#### Mobile hero image on home page

#### Monitor hero image on home page

### Cover text and tagline

The responsive cover text over the hero image states the name of the business and the tagline conveys that we offer lessons. Lessons are what the site user is most likely looking for when they visit this website.

### Benefits of Horse Riding

Allows the site user to understand the benefits that go along with physical exercise and connection to an animal. The user might choose to take horse riding up as a hobby after reading these benefits. The titles of each benfit are links to pages that explain the benefits more.

### A fixed background image

The fixed background image is of a pony called cindy. This is a nice visual that is fun to scroll on a monitor to break up the large about of text that is on the index page. It is not a fixed background image on mobile.

#### Skewball image on mobile

Photos of dressage, polo, horse ball and western riding can be seen here with short explainations of each. There is a video near the bottom of this page that shows a western tack up routine.

### Contact Page

The hero image on the contact page shows a person kissing a horse on the nose because this is a 'feel-good' photo. The contact page has responsive panels with a contact form and an embedded map showing where our farm is located. The form has 4 input boxes, 3 radio buttons and a submit button. Two of the fields are required. The required fields are 'Full Name' and 'Phone'. Optional fields are email and a message. There is placeholder text in each field of the form to promt the user. The user can use the radio buttons to tell us if they would like to talk about lessons, gear or livery.

### Footer

Which displays a clickable business logo, social media links, a copyright and a link to my github, because this is a portfolio website for a ficticious business. The footer is fully responsive depending on the size of the screen one is using.

## Future features

- Live weather forcast. This is a feature on some similar websites that I saw when doing research for this project. I saw a div with a widget that contains live data.
- A page dedicated to gear. This is another popular page on horse riding websites.
- A whisper riding school themed 404 page
- A whisper riding school themed confirmation page, once the form has been submitted. The code institute template one is in place at the moment.
- A masonry photo gallery
- A checkbox to sign-up for a newsletter
- Contact details in the footer e.g. farm address and phone number
- More internal links to make navigation around the site very easy

## Design

### Design Choices

I was very loosely inspired by the colors, layout, services and features of the [Carrickmines Equestrian Center](https://www.carrickminesequestrian.ie/) website. This arose from my research of other horse riding school websites. I wanted to find one with intuitive layout and navigation that fit my desired content and that was also responsive.

The hero image for Whisper Riding School was chosen to convey the exact main service of the business. It is both eye-catching and informational.

### Typography

Google Fonts were used to import Inter and Quicksand fonts into styles.css. A generic sans-serif font was chosen as a back-up font. These were chosen as they are easy to read and are common to modern website design.

### Color

Since this business offers outdoor services such as horse riding lessons I chose earthy colours. Colors were adapted from palettes generated using [Venngage's accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

Primary Colors - White / Green

Secondary Colors - Orange / Mustard / Blue / Off-White

- #c9ac3b, a mustard color that can be see in palette shown
- #88a542, a green that can be see in palette shown
- #5b9c69, a green that can be see in palette shown
- #359672, a green that can be see in palette shown
- #38989c, a bluish color that can be see in palette shown
- #CC864A, an orange inspired by the palette below
- #fffae6, off-white
