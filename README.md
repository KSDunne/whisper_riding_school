## Purpose of the project

Whisper Riding School is a fictitious business. Here is a 3-page, responsive website, built using only HTML and CSS for that business. This website is aimed at people that are interested in trying horse riding as a hobby, in the Leinster area of Ireland. The owner of 'Whisper Riding School' seeks to provide value to these people via horse riding education and in turn convert these interested people into customers of 'Whisper Riding School'. This website provides the user with a history about the farm, information about the benefits of horse riding, provides education on horse riding disciplines from around the world and encourages the user to use a contact form to get further information on lessons, safe riding gear, boarding and livery.

## Features

### Logo and Navigation bar

A responsive navigation bar is in place. Concentrating on 'mobile first' design, the navigation bar incorporates a clickable burger icon with a drop down menu on mobile. When moving to tablet and monitor size the burger disappears and a traditional navigation bar appears with options to navigate to pages; 'Home', 'Around the World' or 'Contact'. There is a clickable horse logo for monitor sizes. This design benefits the user as it is intuitive and a common nav bar design. It is inviting to use, because it is easy to navigate.

#### Monitor navigation bar with clickable horse logo

### Hero Image

The hero image on the index page was chosen to convey the exact purpose of Whisper Riding School. It is a colorful image of a girl jumping a fence on horseback in a sand arena. This is a typical activity you would find at a riding school in Ireland. Therefore, the user can see what typically happens at our farm.

#### Mobile hero image on home page

#### Monitor hero image on home page

### Cover text and tagline

The responsive cover text over the hero image states the name of the business and the tagline conveys that we offer lessons. Lessons are what the site user is most likely looking for when they visit this website.

### Benefits of Horse Riding

Allows the site user to understand the benefits that go along with physical exercise and connection to an animal. The user might choose to take horse riding up as a hobby after reading these benefits. The titles of each benfit are links to pages that explain the benefits more.

### A fixed background image

The fixed background image is of a pony called cindy. This is a nice visual that is fun to scroll on a monitor to break up the large about of text that is on the index page. It is not a fixed background image on mobile.

#### Skewball image on mobile

### Around the World

'Around the World' is the second page of this website and it offers the user 4 educational snippets. The user can learn about riding disciplines from around the world. Photos of dressage, polo, horse ball and western riding can be seen here with short explainations of each. There is a video near the bottom of this page that shows a western tack up routine. There is a 'call to action' to view the video in the text and the video provides interaction for the site user.

#### Around the world hero image on mobile

![Around the world hero image on mobile](docs/aroundtheworld_hero_ss.webp)

#### Education text

Gives the user a snippet of information on each discipline and a link to the wikipedia page about each, so that they can learn more if they would like.

![Education text](docs/education_text.webp)

#### Education image

The education images are visuals carefully chosen to represent each discipline.

![Education image](docs/education_image.webp)

#### Education video

The video is of a western tack-up routine. This is a different routine to the one used in English riding, therefore it is educational for someone that has never seen this alternative way of getting a horse ready for riding before.

![Education video](docs/education_video.webp)

### Contact Page

The hero image on the contact page shows a person kissing a horse on the nose because this is a 'feel-good' photo. The contact page has responsive panels with a contact form and an embedded map showing where our farm is located. The form has 4 input boxes, 3 radio buttons and a submit button. Two of the fields are required. The required fields are 'Full Name' and 'Phone'. Optional fields are email and a message. There is placeholder text in each field of the form to promt the user. The user can use the radio buttons to tell us if they would like to talk about lessons, gear or livery.

### Map

The Google maps feature is embedded in an iframe and this provides the site user the ability to plan their trip to the farm. It is responsive and is different sizes depending on the screen size the user has.

#### Responsive google map

![Google map](docs/responsive_map_ss.webp)

### Footer

Which displays a clickable business logo, social media links, a copyright and a link to my github, because this is a portfolio website for a ficticious business. The footer is fully responsive depending on the size of the screen one is using.

## Future features

- Live weather forcast. This is a feature on some similar websites that I saw when doing research for this project. I saw a div with a widget that contains live data
- A page dedicated to gear. This is another popular page on horse riding websites
- A whisper riding school themed 404 page
- A whisper riding school themed confirmation page, once the form has been submitted. The code institute template one is in place at the moment
- A masonry photo gallery
- A checkbox to sign-up for a newsletter
- Contact details in the footer e.g. farm address and phone number
- More internal links to make navigation around the site very easy

## Design

### Design Choices

I was very loosely inspired by the colors, layout, services and features of the [Carrickmines Equestrian Center](https://www.carrickminesequestrian.ie/) website. This arose from my research of other horse riding school websites. I wanted to find one with intuitive layout and navigation that fit my desired content and that was also responsive.

The hero image for Whisper Riding School was chosen to convey the exact main service of the business. It is both eye-catching and informational.

### Typography

Google Fonts were used to import Inter and Quicksand fonts into styles.css. A generic sans-serif font was chosen as a back-up font. These were chosen as they are easy to read and are common to modern website design.

### Color

Since this business offers outdoor services such as horse riding lessons I chose earthy colors. I also kept accessibility in mind when choosing colors and I used a color blind friendly palette for inspiration. Colors were adapted from palettes generated using [Venngage's accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

Primary Colors - White / Green

Secondary Colors - Orange / Mustard / Blue / Off-White

- #c9ac3b, a mustard color that can be see in palette shown
- #88a542, a green that can be see in palette shown
- #5b9c69, a green that can be see in palette shown
- #359672, a green that can be see in palette shown
- #38989c, a bluish color that can be see in palette shown
- #CC864A, an orange inspired by the palette below
- #fffae6, off-white

![Accessible color palette](docs/accessible_color_palette.webp)

## Wireframes

The overall structure was kept from inception of wireframes to final result of the website, however there are small discrepancies where the project evolved e.g. address can be seen in the footer of the wireframes, but in the final project this went into the contact page. This was because it visually looked better on the contact page and it is easy for the user to find on the contact page. Also, where you see 'contact us' in the nav bar of the wireframes, this ended up being simply 'contact' on the final version of the website, because it looked better and added a better flow to the website.

- A score of 100 was reached for accessibility, best practices and SEO for the contact page

![Contact lighthouse](docs/contact_lighthouse.PNG)

- After reading the source below, it is my opinion that, the 'performance' parameter in lighthouse could have been improved by using high fetch priority on the largest image. I will keep this in mind going forward with future projects.

### Manual testing

#### Responsiveness of features tested using Chrome DevTools

 - All features were tested for the intended look and responsiveness using Chrome DevTools on iPhone SE, 375px wide, iPad Mini, 768px wide and Nest Hub Max,1280px wide

 - I also consistently tested the look and responsiveness down to 300px throughout development

 - All features passed responsiveness testing and looked good on all mentioned devices

 - See responsive feature testing results in the screenshot below

 - Most importantly the 'what we offer' box section, the video, the contact form and the map are all fully responsive

 - I have confirmed that the form works on the contact page. It requires some entries, it will only accept an email in the email box and the submit button works as intended

### Fixed bugs

- A decimal point was used for the height of the whisper riding school logo in order to get an accurate aspect ratio. However, the W3C code validation flagged this as an error in the code. The screenshot below shows the error. This was fixed by using a hight of '42' instead of '42.5'. This value was close enough to satify the correctness of the aspect radio and the error disappeared when the code was run through the validator again.

- The body selector contained a property of min-height and the unit used for this was, viewport height or vh. There was a space between the value and the unit and this showed up as an error when the code was run through the W3C HTML validator. The error was easily fixed by removing the space between the value and the unit.
