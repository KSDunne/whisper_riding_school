                    <p>
                        In dressage, there are certain principles that contribute to a successful performance. The
                        following are some key
                        aspects. The rider should maintain a correct position with the head, shoulder, hip, and knee in
                        line and the back
                        straight. This alignment allows for effective communication and balance between the rider and
                        the horse. The horse's
                        movements should have a clear and regular rhythm. The horse should remain straight on straight
                        lines and show an even
                        bend through turns, circles, and corners. Maintaining proper bend and straightness helps to
                        develop suppleness and
                        flexibility in the horse's body, allowing for fluid and precise movements. By focusing on these
                        aspects, riders can
                        strive for a well-executed dressage performance that showcases the horse's athleticism and
                        partnership with the rider.

                        Nestled amidst gentle countryside, the rich history of Whisper Farm unfolds like a tale
                        whispered in
                        the wind. Founded
                        in 1955 by the equestrian visionary, Margo Dunne, it was a place where the harmony between horse
                        and
                        rider took center
                        stage. From its humble beginnings as a simple stable, Whisper Farm blossomed into an equestrian
                        sanctuary renowned for
                        its ethereal bond between horse and human. Through the years, we have developed groundbreaking
                        training techniques that
                        harnessed the power of communication and trust.
