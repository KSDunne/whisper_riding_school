                    <p>
                        The following are some key aspects that contribute to a successful dressage performance. The
                        rider should maintain a correct position with the head, shoulder, hip and knee in
                        line and the back
                        straight. This alignment allows for effective communication and balance. The horse's
                        movements should have a clear and regular rhythm. The horse should remain straight on straight
                        lines and show an even
                        bend through turns, circles and corners. Maintaining proper bend and straightness helps to
                        develop suppleness and
                        flexibility in the horse's body, allowing for fluid and precise movements. By focusing on these
                        aspects, riders can
                        strive for a well-executed dressage performance that showcases the horse's athleticism and
                        partnership with the rider. Continue reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressage"

                    <p>
                        Polo is a competitive sport played on horseback, where teams hit a ball with a wooden mallet
                        into goals. Polo ponies are typically Thoroughbreds due to their natural agility and speed.
                        The following are some
                        key points about polo. It requires riders to have excellent control over their horses and be
                        able to manoeuvre quickly
                        and accurately to hit the ball. Riders must have good coordination and balance to stay in the
                        saddle while swinging the
                        mallet. Polo ponies need to be agile and have the endurance to complete the fast-paced games.
                        Polo is a team sport and
                        players must work together to strategize and coordinate their movements on the field. It
                        combines
                        athleticism, precision and a deep connection between horse and rider. Continue reading <a

                        Horseball is a sport played on horseback where a ball is handled and goals are scored by
                        shooting it through a hoop with
                        a diameter of 1m. It is a combination of polo, rugby, netball and basketball. It is one of the
                        ten disciplines officially recognized by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports.
                        Horseball
                        originated in France in the 1970s and has since spread across Europe and overseas. The rules of
                        play include a pick up to start
                        the match, where the horse has to be cantering and the opposing team can defend by preventing
                        them from scoring. Players
                        must work together to pass the ball, navigate the field and outmaneuver opponents to secure
                        victory. Continue reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseball"

                        As always before riding, we tack up. A <a href="#video"

                            up routine video</a> can be viewed on this page. Western and English riding are two
                        different styles of horse riding. Here are some of the main
                        differences between the
                        two. The western saddle is bigger, broader and heavier than the English saddle. The western
                        saddle is designed to
                        distribute the rider's weight across the horse's back, be comfortable and functional for the
                        longer rides that the
                        Western saddle was made for. The English saddle is smaller and lighter than the western saddle
                        and serves to help the
                        rider with dressage and jumping movements, keeping the rider's body closer to the horse. In
                        English riding, the rider
                        takes the reins in both hands and uses them to control the speed and direction of the horse
                        through the mouth. In
                        western riding, the rider uses a single hand to hold the reins. The other hand is free and the
                        rider can rest it on
                        their thigh or leave it to hang gracefully on the side. Western horses tend to be compact and
                        capable of steady travel
                        all day with small bursts of speed to chase stray cattle. English style horses tend to be taller
                        aiding their ability to travel over long distances at a variety of speeds, as well as jump over
                        a
                        variety of obstacles.
                        In conclusion, western and English riding have different saddles, riding methods, horse breeds
                        and attire. Continue reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_riding"
