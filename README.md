## Features

### Logo and Navigation bar

A responsive navigation bar is in place. Concentrating on 'mobile first' design, the navigation bar incorporates a clickable burger icon with a drop down menu on mobile. When moving to tablet and monitor size the burger disappears and a traditional navigation bar appears with options to navigate to pages; 'Home', 'Around the World' or 'Contact'. There is a clickable horse logo for monitor sizes. This design benefits the user as it is intuitive and a common nav bar design. It is inviting to use, because it is easy to navigate.

## Design

### Design Choices

I was very loosely inspired by the colors, layout, services and features of the [Carrickmines Equestrian Center] (https://www.carrickminesequestrian.ie/) website.This arised from my research of other horse riding school websites. I wanted to find one with intuitive layout and navigation that fit my desired content and that was also responsive.

The hero image for Whisper Riding School was chosen to convey the exact main service of the business. It is both eye-catching and informational.

### Typography

Google Fonts were used to import Inter and Quicksand fonts into styles.css. A generic sans-serif font was chosen as a back-up font. These were chosen as they are easy to read and are common to modern website design.

### Color

Since this business offers outdoor services such as horse riding lessons I chose earthy colours. Colors were adapted from palettes generated using [Venngage's Accessible color palette generator](https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator).

Primary Colors - White / Green

Secondary Colors - Orange / Mustard / Blue

- #c9ac3b, mustard
- #88a542, a green
- #5b9c69, a green
- #359672, a green
- #38989c, bluish
- #CC864A, orange
